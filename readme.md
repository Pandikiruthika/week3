# Graphics Animation of Random Walk

## Random Walk Assignment
So far, I have been able to use HTML, JavaScript and CSS to create a UI element representing a ball on the web page. You were also able to add animation to this element and make it move on the page.

In step 1 of this activity, you will add JavaScript code that will create three balls within a defined area of the screen. Then, in step two, you will make the three balls move randomly within that area.
- Implement the update() function to add movement to the balls
